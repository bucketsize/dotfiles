# The NMI watchdog is a debugging feature to catch hardware hangs that cause a kernel panic. On some systems it can generate a lot of interrupts, causing a noticeable increase in power usage:
kernel.nmi_watchdog = 0

# The kernel flusher threads will periodically wake up and write `old' data out to disk.  This
# tunable expresses the interval between those wakeups, in 100'ths of a second (Default is 500).
# Increasing the virtual memory dirty writeback time helps to aggregate disk I/O together, thus reducing spanned disk writes, and increasing power saving. To set the value to 60 seconds (default is 5 seconds):
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 2500

# laptop mode knob
vm.laptop_mode = 5
